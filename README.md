# auto-clicker
An easy to use customizable auto clicker.
 

A simple auto clicker i wrote for cookie clicker, but you can it use for anything else.

To start just run the clicker.py file with any python3 interpreter. 
By default press "g" to start the clicking, "j" to stop it and "k" to close the script.

If you have any trouble getting the script it to work on Mac try granting your python interpreter access to the Accessibility Setting.
